    "The homework for HW 5, use the roadmap for building machine learning systems and the sklearn library, train a kNN algorithm and SVM algorithms.  For full credit, perfrom EDA steps and steps to build model in sklearn (step 1 - 6 cleary marked and annotated ) in your .ipynb. Produce learning curves ( accuracy v. number of training examples) for both algorithms and identify whether the learning curves exhibit variance and/or bias. Produce validation curves (accuracy v. hyperparameter) for both algorithms (SVM=C, kNN= # of neighbors) and identify optimal hyperparameters. Which algorithm of the two algorithms performs better?"
